## Jonathan Cohen-Wang and Julia Wu

1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because that can be automated instead of manually done. This should be done with each push rather than when development is completed because any problems should be discovered when they are introduced, not at the end.

2) No, because end-to-end testing is used for user interaction with the website, whereas testing the correctness of function output values can be done directly in the code.

3) The difference between navigation mode and snapshot mode is that navigation mode analyzes a page after it loads and it measures performance, but snapshot mode does not. Snapshot mode analyzes a page in its current state, and it is faster. 

4) Based on the Lighthouse results, three things that we could do to improve are properly size images, preconnect to required origins, and minify JavaScript.
